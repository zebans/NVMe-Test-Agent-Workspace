 Introduction

1.1  Overview

NVM Express® (NVMe®) Base specification defines an interface for host software to communicate with non-
volatile memory subsystems over a variety of memory-based transports and message-based transports.

This document defines mappings of extensions defined in the NVMe Base Specification to a specific NVMe
Transport: RDMA.

1.2  Scope

Figure 1 shows the relationship of the NVM Command Set Specification to other specifications within the
NVMe Family of Specifications.

Figure 1: NVMe Family of Specifications

This  specification  supplements  the  NVMe  Base  Specification.  This  specification  defines  additional  data
structures, features, log pages, commands, and/or status values. This specification also defines extensions
to existing data structures, features, log pages, commands, and/or status values. This specification defines
requirements  and  behaviors  that  are  specific  to  the  RDMA  transport.  Functionality  that  is  applicable
generally  to  NVMe  or  that  is  applicable  across  multiple  NVMe  transports  is  defined  in  the  NVMe  Base
specification.

If  a  conflict  arises  among  requirements  defined  in  different  specifications,  then  a  lower-numbered
specification in the following list shall take precedence over a higher-numbered specification:

1.  Non-NVMe specifications
2.  NVMe Base specification
3.  NVMe transport specifications
4.  NVMe I/O command set specifications
5.  NVMe-MI specification

2  Transport Overview

The RDMA transport provides reliable in-order delivery of capsules and direct data placement of Admin and
I/O command data through the use of RDMA reliable Queue Pair (QP) modes (i.e., Reliable Connected and
Reliable  Datagram).  The  use  of  RDMA  unreliable  QP  modes  is  not  supported.  Refer  to  the  RDMA
specifications and RFCs for a description of RDMA Queue Pair modes.

The RDMA  transport is  RDMA  provider  agnostic. The diagram in  Figure 2 illustrates  the layering of the
RDMA transport and common RDMA providers (iWARP, InfiniBand™, and RoCE) within the host and NVM
subsystem.

Figure 2: RDMA Transport Protocol Layers

The  RDMA  transport  uses  a  common  set  of  RDMA  operations  to  facilitate  the  exchange  of  command
capsules, response capsules, and data. These operations are RDMA_SEND, RDMA_SEND_INVALIDATE,
RDMA_READ, and RDMA_WRITE. The RDMA transport uses RDMA buffer registration and invalidation
operations to facilitate the use of host or NVM subsystem resident buffers for the exchange of data and
metadata for Admin and I/O commands.

In some host and NVM subsystem implementations, the interface between the RDMA transport and the
RDMA providers is defined by an implementation of RDMA Verbs. When applicable, the host and NVM
subsystem RDMA transport implementations should use the common RDMA Verbs software interfaces for
the RDMA transport layer to be RDMA provider agnostic.

  RDMA_LOCAL_INVALIDATE

RDMA operation used to invalidate the local system’s memory key.

  RDMA_READ

RDMA transport depends on the RDMA Connection Management Service (RDMA_CMS) that is used to
establish  NVMe/RDMA  host-controller  communication.  The  RDMA
Internet  Protocol  Connection
Management (RDMA IP CM) Service shall be used with the RDMA transport.

  Hosts and NVM subsystems that support NVMe/RDMA are required to have IP addresses.

These three requirements apply to all RDMA Provider Types.

The RDMA IP CM Service uses the TCP port number indicated by the TRSVCID field as part of establishing
NVMe/RDMA host-controller communication. That TCP port number is not used as a component of RDMA

  Disabling Submission Queue Flow Control

Hosts and controllers that use the RDMA Transport may disable Submission Queue flow control as part of
creating a Submission Queue and Completion Queue pair, refer to the Message-Based Transport Queue
Model section and the Connect Command and Response section in the NVMe Base Specification.

  Fabric Dependent Settings

As part of the RDMA QP creation, the host and remote peer exchange the RDMA_READ resources. This
exchange is typically facilitated by the RDMA provider.

The host RDMA Transport sets the Inbound RDMA Read Queue Depth (IRD) value and passes that value
to the remote peer using these facilities. The remote-peer uses the host’s IRD value to limit the number of
RDMA_READ  operations  that  the  remote-peer  issues  to  the  host.  Exceeding  this  limit  may  result  in  an
RDMA  QP  error.  The  remote  peer  returns  an  IRD  value  of  0h  to  indicate  that  any  host  initiated
RDMA_READ operations will result in an RDMA QP error.

The host RDMA Transport sets the value of RNR_RETRY_COUNT based on the RDMA provider capability.
If the RDMA provider supports RNR_RETRY_COUNT, then the host should set RNR_RETRY_COUNT to
infinite (i.e., a value of 7). If the RDMA provider does not support RNR_RETRY_COUNT, then the host

11

NVM Express® RDMA Transport Specification, revision 1.0

should  set  RNR_RETRY_COUNT  to  0h.  The  remote  peer  shall  match  the  host  RNR_RETRY_COUNT
setting or fail the QP creation.

NVM Express® RDMA Transport Specification, revision 1.0

3.3  Data Transfer Model

The RDMA transport is a message-based transport that uses capsules for data transfer as defined in the
Capsules and Data Transfer section of the NVMe Base Specification.

Capsule exchanges are performed using the RDMA_SEND or RDMA_SEND_INVALIDATE operations.
The RDMA Transport at the host uses RDMA_SEND to transmit command capsules. The RDMA
Transport at the controller uses RDMA_SEND or RDMA_SEND_INVALIDATE to transmit response
capsules and optionally invalidate a host memory key. An RDMA_SEND operation contains at most one
command or response capsule.

All  RDMA_READ  and  RDMA_WRITE  operations  are  initiated  by  the  controller.  Data  transfers  from  a
controller to a host are performed using the RDMA_WRITE operation. Data transfers from a host buffer to
a controller buffer are performed using the RDMA_READ operation. Data for an I/O command may also be
exchanged  from  the  host  to  the  controller  using  a  single  RDMA_SEND  operation  that  contains  the
command capsule and in-capsule data within the RDMA_SEND operation’s message payload.

Host Memory Buffer Addresses are communicated in the command’s SGL entries. Host  Memory Buffer
Addresses are represented as the combination of a memory key, offset, and length. The host is responsible
for allocating the memory buffers, registering the keys, and constructing the SGL entries with the associated
Host Memory Buffer Address.

To  ensure  proper  command  data  to  command  completion  ordering,  all  RDMA_WRITE  data  transfer
operations for a command shall be submitted onto the same RDMA QP prior to submitting the associated
response capsule onto the same RDMA QP.

The detailed flow of the command sequences using RDMA operations is shown in Figure 8.



The host transmits the command capsule to the controller using an RDMA_SEND
operation.

  Command action completed by the controller.


The controller transmits the response capsule to the host using an RDMA_SEND
operation.
The same RDMA QP shall be used for both RDMA_SEND operations.
The host transmits the command capsule to the controller using an RDMA_SEND
operation. The capsule contains or points to SGL(s) required for the data transfer.
The controller uses RDMA_WRITE operation(s) to transfer data from the controller
to the host. Each RDMA_WRITE operation is associated with one keyed remote
host memory buffer (SGL) and one or more local controller memory buffer(s).
The controller transmits the response capsule to the host using an RDMA_SEND
or (optionally) RDMA_SEND_INVALIDATE operation.
The same RDMA QP shall be used for the RDMA_WRITE operation(s) and the
RDMA_SEND operation.
The host transmits the command capsule to the controller using an RDMA_SEND
operation. The capsule contains or points to SGL(s) required for the data transfer.
The capsule may contain in-capsule data, which is pointed to by an offset address
in an SGL within the capsule.
For host-resident command data, the controller uses RDMA_READ operation(s)
to  transfer  the  data  from  the  host  to  the  controller.  Each  RDMA_READ  is
associated  with one keyed remote memory buffer (SGL)  and one or more local
memory buffer(s).
The controller transmits the response capsule to the host using an RDMA_SEND
or (optionally) RDMA_SEND_INVALIDATE operation.
The  same  RDMA  QP  shall  be  used  for  the  RDMA_READ  operation(s)  and  the
RDMA_SEND operation.

  Capsules

The capsule size for Fabrics commands are fixed in size regardless of whether commands are submitted
on an Admin Queue or an I/O Queue. The command capsule size is 64 bytes and the response capsule
size is 16 bytes.

The capsule sizes for the Admin Queue are fixed in size. The command capsule size is 64 bytes and the
response capsule size is 16 bytes. In-capsule data is not supported for the Admin Queue.

Command capsules for I/O commands sent on I/O Queues may contain up to the I/O command capsule
size reported by the I/O Queue Command Capsule Supported Size (IOCCSZ) field multiplied by 16. The
response capsule size shall be 16 bytes and shall not contain in-capsule data.

The RDMA Transport facilitates the use of separate locations for SGLs and data (refer to the Data and SGL
Locations within a Command Capsule section in the NVMe Base Specification).

Admin command data is transferred using host-resident data buffers specified in Keyed SGL Data Block
descriptor entries. I/O command data is transferred using host-resident data buffers specified in Keyed SGL
Data Block descriptor entries or within the capsule. The RDMA Transport supports the SGL Data Block with
Sub Type Offset, SGL Last Segment with Sub Type Offset, and Keyed SGL Data Block descriptors only.
The RDMA Transport does not support SGLs in host memory; all SGLs shall be contained in the command
capsule. Fabrics and Admin commands have one Transport SGL Data Block descriptor or Keyed SGL Data
Block descriptor (i.e., there are no SGL descriptors following the Submission Queue Entry). I/O commands
may have more than one SGL descriptor.

The controller shall set bits 01:00 of the SGLS field to 01b in the Identify Controller data structure (refer to
the Identify Controller data structure in the NVMe Base Specification) (i.e., the controller shall support SGLs
and impose no alignment or granularity requirements for data blocks).

There are SGL Descriptor Sub Type values that are specific to RDMA operation as defined in Figure 10.

not support remote invalidate, then this Sub Type is ignored.

3.4  Keep Alive Model

Keep Alive functionality is not supported by all RDMA Provider Types at the RDMA Transport layer. As a
result, the RDMA Transport requires the use of the Keep Alive Feature (refer to the Keep Alive section in
the NVMe Base specification). It is recommended that any RDMA provider level functionality be disabled
to avoid redundant and conflicting policies.

The RDMA Transport does not impose any limitations on the minimum and maximum Keep Alive Timeout
value. The minimum should be set large enough to account for any transient fabric interconnect failures
between the host and controller.

3.5  Error Handling Model

  RDMA Transport Errors

Errors detected by the RDMA Transport may result in the termination of any command capsule, response
capsule,  or  data  transfer  operations  and  may  result  in  the  tear  down  of  the  RDMA  QP(s).  The  RDMA
Transport may detect errors that are not directly associated with a capsule or data transfer operation (e.g.,
tear down of the RDMA QP due to connection loss, data corruption, or protection error). In the case of a
RDMA QP tear down, the RDMA Transport is responsible for terminating the RDMA QP, freeing up any
NVMe Transport resources, and then informing the NVMe layer about the termination and the associated
cause.

Errors  detected by the RDMA  Transport during RDMA QP establishment are handled within the RDMA
Transport and are not reported to the NVMe layer. These errors are described in Figure 11.

  RDMA Provider Errors

Errors  detected  by  the  RDMA  provider  are  communicated  to  the  local  NVMe  RDMA  Transport  through
implementation  specific  interfaces  (e.g.,  RDMA  Verbs).  RDMA  providers  may  have  facilities  to
communicate  errors  to  the  RDMA  QP  remote  peer.  Details  of  these  facilities  or  their  use  is  outside  the
scope  of  this  specification.  Details  on  the  types  of  errors  and  their  associated  identification  encoding  is
contained within the RDMA provider specifications.

3.6  Transport Specific Content

  Key Management

An RDMA Memory Key (RKEY) is an identifier that associates a data buffer in host memory with a registered
“remote access enabled” RDMA memory region or memory window on an RDMA NIC (RNIC) attached to
a  host.  The  host  NVMe  RDMA  transport  software  manages  the  creation  of  RKEYs,  association  of  the
RKEYs to data buffers, insertion of RKEYs into SGL entries, and invalidation of the RKEYs upon completion
of Fabrics, Admin, or I/O commands. Refer to the Scatter Gather List (SGL)  section in the NVMe Base
Specification for the definition of the Keyed SGL Data Block descriptor.

Commands that require data transfers between a host memory buffer and the controller shall use SGLs
that contain a full RDMA host address tuple consisting of an RKEY,  offset, and length. The host NVMe
RDMA transport is responsible for allocating this tuple by registering the associated data buffers with the
appropriate RNIC to produce the RKEY and then subsequently inserting the RKEY, offset, and length into
the  SGL  entries  associated  with  the  command.  The  same  RKEY  may  be  used  in  multiple  SGL  entries
associated with the same Fabrics, Admin, or I/O command. The RKEY shall be invalidated only after all
RDMA_READ or RDMA_WRITE operations have been completed that use the RKEY.

The host RDMA transport software selects one of two methods to invalidate the RKEY: local invalidate or
remote invalidate. To indicate a remote invalidate, the host sets the Sub Type field in the Keyed SGL Data

Block  descriptor  to  Fh  (refer  to  Figure  10).  If  the  controller  RDMA  transport  does  not  support  remote
invalidate, then the host’s request for remote invalidation is ignored.

The  controller  RDMA  transport  may  or  may  not  honor  the  remote  invalidate  request.  If  honored,  the
controller  RDMA  transport  invalidates  the  RKEY  by  using  the  RDMA_SEND_INVALIDATE  operation  to
return the capsule response. If the command capsule contains multiple SGL entries with the Sub Type field
in the Keyed SGL Data Block descriptor set to Invalidate Key (i.e., Fh), the controller RDMA Transport shall
only invalidate the RKEY in the last Keyed SGL Data Block descriptor.

The  host  RDMA  transport  shall  check  the  RDMA  Receive  Queue  to  determine  if  the  RDMA_SEND_
INVALIDATE was received and check the value of the RKEY that was invalidated. If the controller RDMA
Transport did not invalidate the RKEY as requested, the host is responsible for invalidating the RKEY using
a local invalidate operation.
